    Hello, world!
    =============

    This is a [Monk](http://monkrb.com) skeleton that uses [HAML/SASS](http://haml-lang.com/) and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) for the views. This skeleton lives at [http://github.com/kbingman/pages-skeleton](http://github.com/kbingman/pages-skeleton).

    The page you are looking at was generated by `app/routes/site.rb`, and the template is located at `app/views/pages/home.haml`.

    Settings
    --------

    Check the configuration file at `config/settings.yml`. The keys under each environment can be accessed with the global `monk_settings` function, and you will also find an example in the default route.


    Testing
    -------

    There's user story written for you at `test/stories/site_test.rb`. Start adding whatever you want to test and then run `monk test` or `monk stories`. For convenience, you can also run `rake`, which just invokes `monk test`.

    Dependencies
    ------------

    Gems are included using Bundler. Just run 'bundle install' in your project root directory to install the require gems.
